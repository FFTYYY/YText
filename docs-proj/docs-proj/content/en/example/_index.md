Here in __[this page](./example/index.html)__ I created a demo editor with a rather complete definition of concepts, 
where you can try the editor. The content is from a part of one of my blog posts on convex analysis (translated from Chinese).

The full project can be found [here](https://github.com/FFTYYY/YText/tree/master/example/example-full).
