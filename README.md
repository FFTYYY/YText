# YText

YText is a text editor based on [React](https://reactjs.org/), in the sense of "rich text editors", but it's not really a rich text editor. It's more like LateX, but not a typesetting software either. It's hard to categorize, but anyway, it's a writing tool I developed for smoother blogging. 

YText doesn't have an explicit user interface, it is more like a collection of rules and concepts, and everything is to be defined. It has great flexibility and can be modified in the way users want.
